        <h2>History of Skating</h2>
        <p>The origin of the skateboard is as <strong>ambiguous</strong> as the origin of our Universe. Yet most agree
            it began in the
            <em>United States</em> as simple wooden crates or planks fitted with roller skate wheels, evolving from
            early
            scooter-like designs into surf-inspired boards popular on Southern California hills in the 1950s. Before
            commercial boards existed, skating was entirely DIY, driven by personal creativity and
            self-expression—foundations that continue to define skateboarding today.

        <h2>Skating Through History</h2>
        <p>Three <strong>significant</strong> events in skateboarding history:</p>

        <dl>
            <dt>Sidewalk Surfing (1950s)</dt>
            <dd>Early skateboarding began as surfers attaching roller-skate wheels to wood planks to recreate wave
                riding on land.</dd>

            <dt>Z-Boys Era (1970s)</dt>
            <dd>A revolution in style and aggression, where pool skating and low-to-the-ground turns turned
                skateboarding into a counterculture movement.</dd>

            <dt>Street Explosion (1980s–90s)</dt>
            <dd>Urban terrain became the main stage, establishing stairs, rails, and flip tricks as the modern identity
                of skateboarding.</dd>

        <h2>History of Surfing</h2>

        <p>A long time ago in ancient Polynesia: latter-day Tahiti, perhaps; maybe Samoa or Tonga – or perhaps much
            further north by the dusky shores of ancient Hawaii – locals gazed at the raging whitewash lapping upon
            their island sands. Swimming, until then, had been the main pastime, but now they paddled into the ocean
            with planks of their finest wood, and with zest and zeal, began to take turns riding fiercely down the
            barrels of untamed swells and building sets. Over the centuries, Hawaiians refined this “wave sliding” into
            a sacred cultural practice, blending skill, ritual, and community. As the modern era emerged, surfing began
            to capture the imagination of outsiders. By the late 19th century, tourists on Waikiki Beach marveled at
            locals carving down waves, while Hawaiian princes demonstrated the sport in California, leaving crowds
            amazed. Writers like Mark Twain and Jack London even tried their hand—unsuccessfully—helping to introduce
            surfing to the Western world.</p>

        <h2>Surfing Through History</h2>
        <p>Three <strong>significant</strong> events in surfing history:</p>

        <dl>
            <dt>Heʻe Nalu Origins</dt>
            <dd>Surfing originated in Polynesia as a spiritual, cultural, and athletic tradition later preserved and
                refined in ancient Hawaii.</dd>

            <dt>Global Spread (1900s)</dt>
            <dd>Surfing entered the mainstream as travelers and Hawaiian ambassadors showcased wave riding across the
                U.S., Australia, and Europe.</dd>

            <dt>Big-Wave Frontier</dt>
            <dd>The sport evolved from casual beach riding to extreme surf conditions as new technology enabled heavier
                boards, tow-ins, and giant-wave exploration.</dd>
