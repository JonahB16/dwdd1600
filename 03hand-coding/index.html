        <h1>History</h1>
        <h2>Skating</h2>
        <p>The origin of the skateboard is as ambiguous as the origin of our Universe. Yet most agree it began in the
            United States as simple wooden crates or planks fitted with roller skate wheels, evolving from early
            scooter-like designs into surf-inspired boards popular on Southern California hills in the 1950s. Before
            commercial boards existed, skating was entirely DIY, driven by personal creativity and
            self-expression—foundations that continue to define skateboarding today.</p>

        <h2>Surfing</h2>
        <p>A long time ago in ancient Polynesia: latter-day Tahiti, perhaps; maybe Samoa or Tonga – or perhaps much
            further north by the dusky shores of ancient Hawaii – locals gazed at the raging whitewash lapping upon
            their island sands. Swimming, until then, had been the main pastime, but now they paddled into the ocean
            with planks of their finest wood, and with zest and zeal, began to take turns riding fiercely down the
            barrels of untamed swells and building sets. Over the centuries, Hawaiians refined this “wave sliding” into
            a sacred cultural practice, blending skill, ritual, and community. As the modern era emerged, surfing began
            to capture the imagination of outsiders. By the late 19th century, tourists on Waikiki Beach marveled at
            locals carving down waves, while Hawaiian princes demonstrated the sport in California, leaving crowds
            amazed. Writers like Mark Twain and Jack London even tried their hand—unsuccessfully—helping to introduce
            surfing to the Western world.</p>
